# CS370 - Current / Emerging Trends : Portfolio


- Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, we were asked to design and write the code for a Q-training based algorithm that would use reinforcement learning to navigate a generated maze. We were given two separate python .py files, the TreasureEnvironment.py, and the GameExperience.py. The GameExperience.py handles the experience replay aspects of our intelligent model. This includes the ability to save and store the experienced states from individual episodes. This class object supports the ability for action predictions to be made for the agent based on the current state of the environment. The environment file that we are given provides a reset function to the agent, so that it can reset it's position, it provides a function for updating the state of the model, a function to take an action, to get the reward of an action, to make observations of the current state, to draw the environment, to determine the status of the game, and to check what actions the agent currently has access to that are valid. 


- Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

	- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
	Computer scientists are individuals who study in the field of computation, and study the theories of computers. They study to understand for computers do work, how the hardware that they use to run is built, and the algorithms that are used to operate them. This matters because they are the individuals who are most responsible for pushing forward technological advancement. Computer scientists build the operating systems that our computers run, the machine learning algorithms that are rapidly pushing the development of Artificially intelligent models. All aspects of life are dependent on the software that we right, and it is the responsibility of computer scientists to understand the tools that they work with so that they can hopefully take actions to make those tools better. 
	

    - How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
	I approach problems as a computer scientist very incrementally. I start by determining what outcomes I am looking to create, or what behaviors I am interested in observing, and I use the foundation of knowledge that I have built during my education, along with my intuition to make logical and rational decisions. I decompose the problem that I am interested in solving into manageable components, and I have found that this generally has led me to be able to accomplish the things that I have a passion for doing.
	
    - What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    Personally, I feel that my ethical responsibilities, to the users and organizations that I am employed for is to always give my best work, to the best of my ability. To be considerate of the results of my product and actions, and to show accountability for my actions. I should always treat the agency and lives of others with the same respect that I would want to be treated with. In addition to always doing my best to be honest with myself about any biases that I find, so that I can hopefully make progress in accounting for those biases, even if they are not my own.
